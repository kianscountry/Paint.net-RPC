# Paint.net RPC
 Heyo! I made this paint.net rpc as I couldn't find any on the plugins page on paint.net! Feel free to use this if you want ^_^

 to run it you can either mate a .bat file doing 'cd Paint.net-RPC node .' or you can open the JS file in VSC and just make a new terminal doing 'node .'!

 thanks for using this! 

 (i will try to figure out how  to make this a plugin for paint.net :3)
